Description: Stackable dynamic tree based Rack router
 Rack::Mount supports Rack's "X-Cascade" convention to continue trying routes
 if the response returns "pass". This allows multiple routes to be nested or
 stacked on top of each other. Since the application endpoint can trigger the
 router to continue matching, middleware can be used to add arbitrary
 conditions to any route. This allows you to route based on other request
 attributes, session information, or even data dynamically pulled from a
 database.
